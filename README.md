Adapted Token-Aware Virtual Adversarial Training for the Named Entity Recognition problem and made different alterations to it with the purpose of empirically finding promising directions in virtual adversarial training to improve the generalization of deep learning models. The studied alterations included the initialization of the token-level perturbations, removal of the token-level constraint in the norm, learning the function for the combining of the embeddings and pertubations, and the effect of different types of noise on the word embeddings.
